17-Jun,15:53,2cefa6ee-f38c-43ea-a413-8471e320da6d,fsa enrollment,Enroll_in_Plan,100%,Happy to help! FSA stands for a Flexible Spending Account. A FSA allows you to make pre-tax contributions to pay for medical  vision and dental expenses within that calendar year.  If you are enrolled in one of the High Deductible Health Plans  you are only eligible to enroll in a LPFSA (Limited Purpose FSA). A LPFSA will only allow for dental and vision expenses. All FSA expenses must be incurred during the plan year  January 1 through December 31. But luckily  you have a grace period  you have 90 days after the end of the plan year (March 31) to submit eligible expenses for reimbursement. IRS rules mandate that you forfeit any unused money left in your accounts each year. Keep in mind  our integration with https://www.wageworks.com|WageWorks  our FSA carrier  occurs every Friday evening. Once you submit your enrollment you should be in the system in about a week. When you register  please use the LAST four digits of your employee ID. To learn more about FSA head to https://benefitstream.net|BenefitStream.net.  Username: workday Password: welcome2benefits,,
